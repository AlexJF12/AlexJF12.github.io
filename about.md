Hi! I'm Alex, an aspiring Data Scientist with a background in Global Public Health. You've come to my blog, where I post interesting snapshots of various analytical projects I've worked on. I originally coded in R, but have since switched to Python. Most of my code will be hosted in my GitHub. Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
